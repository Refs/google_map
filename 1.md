1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,340
in this guide I'm going to walk through

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,190
exactly how we can work with promises in

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,340
typescript however before we can talk

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,790
about this I want to give more of a

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,860
explanation on what promises are and

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,920
thankfully because of the way promises

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,320
were created and how its named it's

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,480
pretty easy and straightforward to

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,060
compare it to a real-world scenario and

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,380
that is of a promise in real life so

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,289
imagine that I come to you and I say

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,309
that I am going to mow your lawn now

13
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,730
that is a promise that I've made you now

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,320
there's a couple things that could

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,719
happen when I say I'm going to move your

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,329
lawn there are three scenarios the first

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,649
one is that I go outside and I start

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,620
mowing that's scenario 1 and in

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,899
typescript we would say that this is the

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,449
pending status this is kind of like what

21
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,629
happens when we make an API request and

22
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,670
it creates a promise or it starts a

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,850
promise and we're waiting to see what is

24
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,909
going to happen now taking the mowing

25
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,890
example further if I complete the mowing

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,110
process I'm going to come back and I'm

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,390
going to say I'm done and in that case I

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,670
was successful in I fulfilled my promise

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,670
in typescript we would say that this is

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,490
been resolved the key word here is

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,369
resolved and that means that the promise

32
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,950
proved to be true came back successful

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,880
and everything went as planned however

34
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,140
what happens if I run away and I just

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,549
start running down the street and I do

36
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,520
not mow your lawn that means that I did

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,409
not complete the mowing process

38
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:57,149
successfully now there is a special term

39
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,579
for this and this is going to be called

40
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,960
the reject status and what this would be

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,590
akin to is sending out an API request

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,530
and having an error message come back

43
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,470
either the server was down

44
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,730
or any number of various errors in if

45
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,500
you want to take this a step further in

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,320
the analogy it isn't that always the

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,050
case that maybe I lied about moving the

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,730
lung that also it could be that I went

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,460
outside to mow the lawn and there was no

50
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,160
gas in the lawnmower or the lawn mowers

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,710
broken or something like that all kinds

52
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,570
of different reasons why I may not be

53
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,690
able to hold true to my promise

54
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,430
just like there's all kinds of reasons

55
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,180
why a program may not be able to fulfill

56
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,940
the promise successfully however what I

57
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,550
really want to kind of impart to you is

58
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,190
the three stages of a promise one is

59
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,710
when it's pending the next is when it's

60
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,470
successful which is what we'll call

61
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,570
resolved and the last one is when it's

62
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,850
rejected so those are the three things

63
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,790
and I'm going to keep this comment here

64
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,530
in the source code just so you have

65
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,420
access to it so you have kind of that

66
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,950
analogy in your mind because when I was

67
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,260
learning about promises I heard a kind

68
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,760
of a similar analogy and that was one of

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,010
the things that really made it clear to

70
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,250
me now in order to use promises in the

71
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,800
version of typescript we're using we

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,660
need to put something at the top of the

73
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,000
file and actually I'm going to put the

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,209
very top of the file just so it's clear

75
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,640
that's being used and this is going to

76
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,330
be called use strict now what this means

77
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,459
is that we're going to be using the

78
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,430
strict definition or the strict process

79
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,310
in JavaScript if you have any experience

80
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,680
with JavaScript and you probably have

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,739
heard about the strict process or the

82
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,440
strict syntax and that's what we're

83
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,200
doing here it doesn't really change how

84
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
we're going to be building the program

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,070
it's simply something that is required

86
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,880
for the typescript compiler for this es6

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,690
version as a side note if you're keeping

88
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,050
your compiler options in your TS config

89
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,630
file if you go back to some of your

90
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,840
previous classes let or your previous

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,359
coursework such as the work that we did

92
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,720
with classes or some of those things or

93
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,780
even anyone that has the let statement

94
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,350
in cool

95
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,010
did that is going to now no longer work

96
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,370
without putting use strict at the top so

97
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,110
just as a side note if you go and try to

98
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,090
rerun any of those programs and you get

99
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,100
an error if you're using the gnu

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,930
compiler options you just have to put

101
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,090
that at the top and you'll be good to go

102
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,450
so now let's move on forward and let's

103
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,670
talk about how we can create a promise

104
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,460
so usually the way promises are created

105
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,890
this is a traditional way is we're going

106
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,230
to create an anonymous functions we're

107
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,640
going to create a function expression

108
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,490
and for example in this guide I'm going

109
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,110
to mimic the process of uploading a

110
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,610
image to a either an image or anything

111
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,570
like that

112
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,150
uploading that to a server and we're

113
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,940
going to have a number of processes that

114
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,430
we're going to force to happen in a

115
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,300
specific order so I'm going to call this

116
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,590
function perform upload and it says

117
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,840
we're going to set it equal to an

118
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,810
anonymous function and this function is

119
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,120
going to take one parameter the

120
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,310
parameter is going to be image status

121
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,610
and that's going to be of type string

122
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,080
now this is going to return a promise

123
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,870
so this promise is going to be returned

124
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,440
and also we're going to pass a key value

125
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,860
pair inside of this promise so we're

126
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,640
going to inside of it put put the angle

127
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,120
brackets and inside of that place image

128
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,930
status and set that equal to string so

129
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,490
what that's going to what we're

130
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,190
essentially saying is this program is

131
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,710
going to return a promise and this

132
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,280
promise is going to contain a status and

133
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,950
that is what's going to be returned when

134
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,130
perform upload is called now the next

135
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,630
thing we're going to do is we need to

136
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,670
actually return it so we're going to say

137
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,200
return new promise and inside of the

138
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,630
promise we're going to pass a couple

139
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,220
things first thing we're going to pass

140
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,800
is going back to our lawnmower example

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,879
we need to pass in what we'll

142
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,330
happen when the item is successful so we

143
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,529
need to pass in a resolved argument and

144
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,289
what this is saying is that when the

145
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,779
item is successful we're going to be

146
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,080
resolving this process so this is what's

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,789
going to happen when that occurs and

148
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,789
what I want to do and notice how I'm

149
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,639
using our fat arrow syntax for the

150
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,990
function here I'm going to console.log

151
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,459
out something and we're going to use

152
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,199
string interpolation so use the back

153
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,159
ticks and I'm gonna say status and I'm

154
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,830
going to set the status equal to

155
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,679
whatever the value of image status is

156
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,919
and right after the curly brackets I'm

157
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,800
going to do another backtick and in that

158
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,529
line of code and because I want to kind

159
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,379
of mimic a real-world process I'm going

160
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:31,539
to put a set timeout function in here

161
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:36,069
and with set timeout this one if you

162
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,899
remember back to when we did this in our

163
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,479
callback we're going to pass that time

164
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,119
out a nother function and we're going to

165
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:46,509
use another fat arrow in order to do it

166
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,999
and inside of the fat arrow we're going

167
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:54,129
to place exactly what we want this to do

168
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:57,729
so here inside of the set timeout this

169
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,829
is where we're going to pass resolve now

170
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:03,729
if you notice resolve is going to work

171
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,789
like a function here so resolve even

172
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,129
though you notice that resolve is an

173
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,289
argument we're going to pass this

174
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:15,039
argument a function and we need to pass

175
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,579
in the value that we want to return so

176
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:21,909
if what really is happening here is that

177
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,209
when a success full promise has occurred

178
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,249
so there's no issues and everything

179
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:29,110
comes back what we're saying is that

180
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,380
we're going to return the image status

181
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,550
and remember we're returning this as a

182
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,620
key value pair and if part of this still

183
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,149
seems a little bit confusing

184
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,430
do not worry we're going to go through

185
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,100
and kind of go line by line on exactly

186
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,320
what's happening to review here

187
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,779
and I want to pause this for one second

188
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,649
so I'm going to put in a 1000

189
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,000
millisecond call here and that is it

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,730
except for adding a semicolon to the end

191
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,300
of this and that is a promise and so

192
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,410
it's going to make a little bit more

193
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,209
sense everything that's going on here

194
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,029
when we actually call the promise so the

195
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:15,579
first thing I'm going to do is create

196
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:18,459
some variables so I'm going to say var

197
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:23,019
upload var compress and then var

198
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:27,730
transfer and now that we have all this

199
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,310
in place now we can actually call our

200
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,220
promise so our promise is called perform

201
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,470
upload and in order to start this we're

202
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,410
going to pass in whatever status we want

203
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,560
to do so in this case I'm going to say

204
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,579
uploading and then we're going to

205
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:52,620
process the very special key word then

206
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,449
now if you've never worked with promises

207
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,519
before then you may have never heard of

208
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,790
the word then in programming but I like

209
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,430
it because it's very nice and sequential

210
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,740
and it's a great way of organizing code

211
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,829
because to me it almost reads like

212
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,380
English so the way we're going to do

213
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,389
this is start a new line you could put

214
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,430
all this on the same line however that

215
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,750
would be very difficult to read so

216
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,360
standard convention is to put it on a

217
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,300
new line so we're going to call the

218
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,569
function then and inside of then then

219
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:29,670
takes an argument and it takes in a

220
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,680
callback so we're going to say we're

221
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,579
going to pass in the response and then

222
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:39,420
inside of that we're going to use our

223
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,120
fat arrow and we're going to pass in the

224
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,300
response and set up load which is the

225
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,310
variable that we created right here and

226
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,910
we're going to set up load equal to the

227
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,329
response

228
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,809
and then I want to return a value in

229
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:02,079
this function and I'm guess a perform

230
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,569
upload so we're calling the promise

231
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:07,809
again but now we're going to pass in the

232
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:12,220
value of compressing which is another

233
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,269
image status and let me just copy and

234
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:18,399
paste this code because we're going to

235
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,600
use this for each one of the statuses so

236
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,429
we're going to do that one and then

237
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,170
we're going to do one more but this last

238
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,290
one is the final one so this one's going

239
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,600
to be slightly different so this one is

240
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,839
going to say transferring and we're not

241
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,670
going to set upload equal to it we're

242
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,920
going to set compress equal to it and

243
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,100
then last one is going to be transfer

244
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,480
and this one is going to say image

245
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:01,199
upload completed very end add a

246
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:05,199
semicolon and this should all work so

247
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,980
let me come over here to the terminal

248
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,649
run the code everything looks like it

249
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,009
worked there this is number 29 promises

250
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,899
in case you're following along with the

251
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,449
source code you can see it uploads

252
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,329
compresses transfers and the image

253
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,949
upload process has worked okay so that

254
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,049
worked however if you've never worked

255
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,899
with promises before this probably

256
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,540
didn't make a lot of sense and so I want

257
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,249
to circle back and kind of go through

258
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:40,299
each element and kind of analyze what

259
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:44,379
it's doing so in review here this is our

260
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,199
actual promise so our promise is called

261
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,290
perform upload and our promise is an

262
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,110
anonymous function it takes an image

263
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,919
status which is a string value and then

264
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,350
it is going to expect that we're going

265
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,379
to return a promise because we said that

266
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,839
we're going to expect to return this

267
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,990
that's why the first thing we do is we

268
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,059
say return

269
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,339
new promise so this means that when this

270
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,829
function is called it's not going to

271
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,949
take in you know say a it's not going to

272
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:18,809
come back with a console.log statement

273
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:22,589
by itself or anything like that it's

274
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,269
actually going to return an entire

275
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,669
promise object and that's what we're

276
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,399
doing right here when we say return new

277
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,249
promise now a promise itself it takes in

278
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,229
it because at the end of the day it's a

279
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:39,359
class but whenever you create a new

280
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:42,509
promise it expects a call back so if you

281
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:45,059
remember our guide on callbacks that's

282
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,399
what this is right here so we're passing

283
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,699
in a function to promise and we're

284
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,789
saying when this resolves which if you

285
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,739
remember that means when it's successful

286
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:58,859
I want you to do everything inside of

287
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:00,629
here so that's all it's saying it's

288
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:03,449
saying that when this occurs then I want

289
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,819
you to do all of this cool stuff I want

290
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:09,449
you to console.log out this value I want

291
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,699
you to say the image status and remember

292
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,769
we're getting image status because every

293
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,799
time we call perform upload right here

294
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,959
we're passing in a value you can even

295
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,509
come down here and see it first time we

296
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:24,089
call it we're passing in uploading then

297
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,189
we call it we're passing in compressing

298
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,709
next time we call it we're transferring

299
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,869
and last we're doing it when it's

300
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,989
complete so it takes in this value and

301
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:36,449
then it passes it to the status and then

302
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,839
from there we are setting a timeout and

303
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,779
this one's just to give us a pause I

304
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,189
mean if we got rid of all this it would

305
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:45,839
run through but it would all look like

306
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,059
it ran through instantly what this is

307
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:50,549
doing is it's giving us one second pause

308
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:54,419
and it is going to be running the

309
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,509
resolve code so it's going to be running

310
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,939
it's saying that this was successful and

311
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:02,519
it's passing in the image status and

312
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,279
this is what would be returned we're not

313
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,009
actually working on you know the values

314
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,659
that are returned so it's not that big

315
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,579
of a deal but I wanted to show how you

316
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,819
would usually pass in the resolved

317
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:18,629
status because in we as far as what we

318
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:20,939
can see this is all the code we're

319
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,290
actually seen how

320
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,899
ever in a real life call back here in

321
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,089
real life promise you'd want to return a

322
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,009
real value so say that this image

323
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,480
uploader was connected to like a s 3 CDN

324
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,690
or API the where you're passing up image

325
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,089
uploads and you want to be able to have

326
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,399
them processed this would be the value

327
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,569
you'd actually get which is the resolved

328
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,639
status and then you could include that

329
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,560
in the rest of your code so this would

330
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,769
return the value and then everything

331
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,779
that's so that's the entire promise now

332
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,019
moving down we created these variables

333
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,120
just so you know we could have variables

334
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,220
we could assign things to and then we

335
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,519
could you create stages for the promise

336
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,730
so if we imagine that our upload process

337
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,819
included the uploading compressing the

338
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:13,769
file and then transferring it to a

339
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,110
different server then that's these

340
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,420
that's what these three stages represent

341
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,910
so the first thing we're doing is we're

342
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,100
calling the promise we're passing in

343
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,839
uploading when this is completed then it

344
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,050
hits this then method so it hits and

345
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,079
then and if you're wondering what then

346
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,889
takes in it takes in a callback and it

347
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,839
takes specifically it takes in the

348
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,959
response so if you want to imagine what

349
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,610
this would look like you know real life

350
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,250
application perform upload would be like

351
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,440
the user clicking the upload button on

352
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,980
the website that sends up uploading and

353
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,880
it connects to the server from then the

354
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,250
system is going to say ok well what do

355
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,589
you want me to do next that's what the

356
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,959
then keyword really represents and so

357
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,730
we're saying I want you to start the

358
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,790
upload when this is complete then the

359
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,429
server is going to send back a response

360
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,490
message that's what our es is short for

361
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,990
it's short for response and we could

362
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,220
change each one of these to be a

363
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,919
response I just did our es because

364
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,540
that's kind of the standard convention

365
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,699
but what it means is this is what the

366
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,880
server is responding back with now we

367
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,669
get that because this promise is going

368
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,130
to return the value you remember when I

369
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,980
talked about the resolve item and what

370
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,330
it were

371
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,820
turns that's what it's doing is it's

372
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,190
passing this value and then we're

373
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,490
setting up load equal to response and

374
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,640
then we return and we kind of continue

375
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,769
the chain so the next thing is we're

376
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:51,529
performing an upload we're taking in the

377
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,570
value of compressing and we keep on

378
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,880
moving down all the way until it's

379
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,309
complete each one of these is simply a

380
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:01,399
stage it uses the then keyword so that

381
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,070
it can make the whole process sequential

382
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,850
logically and then it that in turn takes

383
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,210
in whatever the response was on the

384
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,510
previous process so here it takes in the

385
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,720
response of uploading here it takes in

386
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,600
the response from compressing and here

387
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,880
it takes in the transferring response

388
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,080
and that is how you can work with

389
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,250
promises in typescript
